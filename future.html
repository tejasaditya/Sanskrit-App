 The last European Renaissance developed three subjects: Art, Music and Science
to shape the world we live in today. It had its beginning in Florence.
The great Humanist Marsilio Ficino made Plato available to the masses
by translating it from Greek to Latin. We live in exciting times and
may well be at the beginning of a new Renaissance. It also will be
based on three new subjects: Some say that these will be Economics,
Law and Language.
<BR/><BR/>
Language has to become more universal now as we can connect with each
other globally within seconds. NASA America's Space Program is
actively looking at Sanskrit in relation to I.T. and artificial
intelligence.

and clearly-formed and full and vibrant and subtle...".</I>

<font  size="6" face="Verdana">Advantages of Sanskrit -:</font>
<ol type="I">
<li>Makes  mind bright, sharp and clear.</li>
<li>Makes us feel peaceful and happy.</li>
<li>Makes us feel BIG.</li>
<li>Cleans and loosens your tongue so you can pronounce any language easily.</li>
<li>Gives us access to a vast and liberating literature.</li>

<li>Can describe all aspects of human life from the most abstract
philosophical to the latest scientific discoveries, hinting at further
developments.</li>
</ol>

Sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit. The precision play of
Sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings
to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that
would inevitably transform the mind. In fact, the mere learning of
Sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum
leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will
provide in the arena of future communication. 
<BR/><BR/>
After many thousands of years, Sanskrit still lives with a vitality
that can breathe life, restore unity and inspire peace on our tired
and troubled planet. It is a sacred gift, an opportunity. The future
could be very bright.
<BR/><BR/>
One thing is certain; Sanskrit will only become the planetary language
when it is taught in a way which is exiting and enjoyable. Furthermore
it must address individual learning inhibitions with clarity and
compassion in a setting which encourages everyone to step forth, take
risks, make mistakes and learn.
